Logic - The basic idea is to find someone who trusts noone, and then check if n-1 people trust them. Now, we try to combine both of these. Create a score matrix. Score = no. of people who trust you - no. of people you trust. At the end, if there's a person who trusts noone and everyone else trusts them, then their score will be (n-1) - (0) = n-1. That's the town judge! 

Code -

class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        score = [0]*(n+1)
        
        for [truster, trustee] in trust:
            
            # you lose a point if you trust someone
            score[truster] -= 1
            # you gain a point if someone trusts you
            score[trustee] += 1
            
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if score[i] == n-1:
                return i

        return -1
