Logic - Initialize a counter to zero. For every character in the list of stones, check if the character is present in the list of jewels, if yes, increment the counter.

Code -

class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for stone in S:
            if stone in J:
                count += 1
        return count
